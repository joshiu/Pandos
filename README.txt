Phase 3 is fully operational. We can successfully run all 8 processes, 
and can perform a read from terminal, write to terminal, and write to printer
successfully. We did not include any optimizations, since it took a while to 
debug all the issues we had. 

We created 2 programs to run with our phase 3. The first is called factorial15, 
which recursively computes 15!. We created this because our read from terminal 
was not fully functional, and we thought it'd be good to have something in case
we didn't get it to work. This program is fully operational and outputs a message
when we begin to calculate the factorial and when it finishes. 

The second program we made is called panlindromeTester. It allows the user to input 
any palindrome, and it will check to see if it is truly a palindrome. You can enter 
single characters, and they WILL register as palindromes. If you just click enter 
without inputting any characters, a nice message shows up :) We included this because
we FINALLY got the read from terminal to work.

That's all with regards to phase 3. Thanks for your patience and for the frustratingly
fun semester Mikey!
